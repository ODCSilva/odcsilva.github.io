		<p>
			I am passionate about software development because I can use it as a creative
			outlet. Some people paint, sculpt, or sing. I program.
		</p>
		<p>
			I first got interested in software development during my late teens when I became
			fascinated with video game development and design.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a problem solver. I enjoy finding creative solutions to challenging
			problems and use my skills to overcome them. I have an insatiable thirst to
			learn about new technologies and applying them in future endeavors.
