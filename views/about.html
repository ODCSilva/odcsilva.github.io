			I am a software developer/designer living in Nova Scotia’s Halifax Regional
			Municipality. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, United States, where I
			lived for 27 years prior to moving to Nova Scotia.
		</p>
		<p>
			I first got interested in software development during my late teens, when I
			became fascinated with video game development. I taught myself a little bit
			of <em>C++</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and later <em>C#</em>. I also learned to use graphic suites like
			<em>PainShopPro</em>, and later <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> and <em>Illustrator</em>. I’ve also done some
			3D modeling work with <em>3DS Max</em> and <em>Maya</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			After moving to Nova Scotia, I decided to complete my post-secondary education,
			and I am now a 2nd-year Information Technology Student at the NSCC Institute
			of Technology campus, in Halifax (Though it is likely I’ve graduated by now
			and I’ve been too lazy to update this section.)
		</p>
		<p>
			I am passionate about software development because I can use it as a creative
			outlet. Some people paint, sculpt, or sing. I program.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a problem solver. I enjoy finding creative solutions to challenging
			problems and use my skills to overcome them. I have an insatiable thirst to
			learn about new technologies and applying them in future endeavors.

			Welcome to my portfolio.
