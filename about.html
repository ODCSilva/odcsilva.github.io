<h1 md-colors="{color:'primary'}" class="section-header">About_Me_</h1>
<p>
	I am a software developer/designer living in Nova Scotia’s Halifax Regional
	Municipality. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, United States, where I
	lived for 27 years prior to moving to Nova Scotia.
</p>
<p>
	I first got interested in software development during my late teens, when I
	became fascinated with video game development. I taught myself a little bit
	of <em>C++</em>, JavaScript, and later C#. I also learned to use graphic suites like
	PainShopPro, and later Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I’ve also done some
	3D modeling work with 3D Studio Max and Maya.
</p>
<p>
	After moving to Nova Scotia, I decided to complete my post-secondary education,
	and I am now a 2nd-year Information Technology Student at the NSCC Institute
	of Technology campus, in Halifax (Though it is likely I’ve graduated by now
	and I’ve been too lazy to update this section.)
</p>
<p>
	I consider myself an artist and I use software development as a creative outlet.
	 Some people paint, sculpt, or sing. I program.
</p>
<p>
	I am a problem solver. I enjoy finding creative solutions to challenging
	problems and use my skills to overcome them. I have an insatiable thirst to
	learn about new technologies and applying them in future endeavors.
